# Asteroids

#### Play it [here](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user38_pPG4Ld6feY_2.py)

This is the classic game of Asteroids, created as part of [Interactive Programming in Python](https://www.coursera.org/course/interactivepython1) on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org), and provided by Rice University.

Each week a new game problem is set, and the code is peer-reviewed. This is the final project of an 8-week online course.

The code cannot be run locally as it was written for use in [CodeSkulptor](www.codeskulptor.org), an IDE for Python in the browser. You can run the code where it is hosted by CodeSkulptor [here](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user38_pPG4Ld6feY_2.py).
